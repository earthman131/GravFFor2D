# GravFFor2D

A wavenumber-domain approach for quasi 3-D forward modeling of gravity anomalies and gradients.

Developed by Lianghui Guo and Yatong Cui.

# Principles

GravFFor2D is a Matlab code for gravity forward modeling of a 3D mesh model in the wavenumber domain. Suppose that the 3D density model consists of several flat layers with the same thickness from top to bottom, and each layer is composed of a set of regularly arranged vertical prisms with the same size but different values of density . GravFFor2D is suitable for fast forward gravity modeling due to a large-scale model and can directly calculate the anomalies and gradients of the flat observational surface.

# Prerequisites

The code being implemented in MATLAB, it requires the MATLAB software, which is licensed under the MathWorks sofware company. MATLAB can be downloaded at the following link https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/, and more information can be found about the license fee on the website.

# Usage

To launch the program, it just requires to dowload ‘Matlab_Code’ from my repositories and execute the script main_gravity2d_forward.m on MATLAB.
